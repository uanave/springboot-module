  **Overview**
-----------
  The ​Dr. House Hospital​ series of web applications is a decentralized system for the simplified management of patients within a hospital. The decentralized system consists of several web applications that communicate between each other in order to accomplish the main goal. This provides the developer a glimpse of how a basic microservice architecture works.

  1. Admission: provides the patient with a unique identifier and forwards it to the diagnoses web app.
  2. Diagnoses: provides the patient a diagnosis depending on their symptoms and forwards it to the treatments web app.
  3. Treatments: provides the patient the right treatment and forwards it to the accountancy web app.
  4. Accountancy: provides the patient with the invoice for the services offered in the hospital.
